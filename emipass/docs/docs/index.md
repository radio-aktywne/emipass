Emission WebSocket to SRT passthrough ðŸ’¨

`emipass` is a [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org) server that receives WebSocket audio stream
and sends it as [`SRT`](https://www.haivision.com/products/srt-secure-reliable-transport) stream.

To start the server make sure you have [`node`](https://nodejs.org) installed, then `cd` into `src` and run:

```sh
./start.sh
```

You can send your stream using WebSockets to [`ws://localhost:10000`](ws://localhost:10000) by default and send your own audio.
